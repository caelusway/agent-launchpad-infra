## üí° Custom Use Case Development

Need help with a custom use case? Here's how to approach it:

### 1. Define Your Requirements
- **Purpose**: What problem does your agent solve?
- **Platform**: Where will it operate (Discord, Telegram, Web)?
- **Audience**: Who will interact with it?
- **Features**: What capabilities does it need?

### 2. Design Your Agent
- **Personality**: Define system prompt, bio, and style
- **Knowledge**: What domain knowledge does it need?
- **Plugins**: Which Eliza plugins will you use?
- **Resources**: CPU, memory, and scaling requirements

### 3. Deploy and Test
- **Start Small**: Begin with basic functionality
- **Iterate**: Improve based on user feedback
- **Monitor**: Track performance and usage
- **Scale**: Expand features and capacity as needed

### 4. Production Considerations
- **Security**: Implement proper authentication and monitoring
- **Reliability**: Set up health checks and failover
- **Performance**: Optimize for your expected load
- **Maintenance**: Plan for updates and improvements
